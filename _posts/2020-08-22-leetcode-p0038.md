博文中会简要介绍Leetcode P0038题目分析及解题思路。

“Count and Say”是一道比较简单的题目，题目描述其实不是很清晰，大致是说一开始有个1，然后下次一边数一边说，即“有一个1”，即“one 1”也就是“11”，然后下一次说“有两个1”，即“two one(s)”也就是“21”，以此类推。

> The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
> ```
> 1     1
> 2     11
> 3     21
> 4     1211
> 5     111221
> ```
> 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.  
> 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.  
> 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.  
> 
> Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.
> 
> Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

以下是C++的题解代码实现。
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n == 1)
            return "1";
        
        string last_row = "1#";
        string curr_row = "";
        for (int idx=2; idx<=n; ++idx) {
            int length = last_row.length();
            curr_row = "";
            int count = 1;
            for (int itr=0; itr<length-1; ++itr){
                if (last_row[itr] == last_row[itr+1])
                    ++count;
                else {
                    curr_row += to_string(count)+last_row[itr];
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
            
            last_row = curr_row+"#";
        }
        return curr_row;
    }
};
```
