博文中会简要介绍Leetcode P0060题目分析及解题思路。

“Permutation Sequence”是是一道比较纯粹的数学题，虽然可以通过深度优先搜索解答，但是很容易超时，所以本文着重介绍数学方法。

> The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
> 
> By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
> ```
> "123"
> "132"
> "213"
> "231"
> "312"
> "321"
> ```
> Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
> 
> Note:
> 
> Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
> Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

关于解题思路的详细分析，在Java代码注释里写的十分明了，这里不再赘述。

以下是Java的题解代码实现。
```java
class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        /**
         * The pattern was that:
         *
         * say n = 4, you have {1, 2, 3, 4}
         * If you were to list out all the permutations you have
         *
         * 1 + (permutations of 2, 3, 4)
         * 2 + (permutations of 1, 3, 4)
         * 3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4)
         * 4 + (permutations of 1, 2, 3)
         *
         * We know how to calculate the number of permutations of n numbers... n! 
         * So each of those with permutations of 3 numbers means there are 6 possible permutations.
         * Meaning there would be a total of 24 permutations in this particular one. 
         * So if you were to look for the (k = 14) 14th permutation, it would be in the
         *
         * 3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4) subset.
         *
         * To programmatically get that, 
         * you take k = 13 (subtract 1 because of things always starting at 0) and divide that by the 6 we got from the factorial, which would give you the index of the number you want. 
         * In the array {1, 2, 3, 4}, k/(n-1)! = 13/(4-1)! = 13/3! = 13/6 = 2. 
         * The array {1, 2, 3, 4} has a value of 3 at index 2. So the first number is a 3.
         * Then the problem repeats with less numbers.
         *
         * The permutations of {1, 2, 4} would be:
         *
         * 1 + (permutations of 2, 4)
         * 2 + (permutations of 1, 4)
         * 4 + (permutations of 1, 2)
         *
         * But our k is no longer the 14th, because in the previous step, we've already eliminated the 12 4-number permutations starting with 1 and 2. 
         * So you subtract 12 from k.. which gives you 1. Programmatically that would be...
         *
         * k = k - (index from previous) * (n-1)! = k - 2*(n-1)! = 13 - 2*(3)! = 1
         *
         * In this second step, permutations of 2 numbers has only 2 possibilities,
         * meaning each of the three permutations listed above a has two possibilities, giving a total of 6. 
         * We're looking for the first one, so that would be in the 1 + (permutations of 2, 4) subset.
         * Meaning: index to get number from is k / (n - 2)! = 1 / (4-2)! = 1 / 2! = 0.. from {1, 2, 4}, index 0 is 1
         * so the numbers we have so far is 3, 1... and then repeating without explanations.
         *
         * {2, 4}
         *
         * k = k - (index from pervious) * (n-2)! = k - 0 * (n - 2)! = 1 - 0 = 1;
         * third number's index = k / (n - 3)! = 1 / (4-3)! = 1/ 1! = 1... from {2, 4}, index 1 has 4
         * Third number is 4
         *
         * {2}
         *
         * k = k - (index from pervious) * (n - 3)! = k - 1 * (4 - 3)! = 1 - 1 = 0;
         * third number's index = k / (n - 4)! = 0 / (4-4)! = 0/ 1 = 0... from {2}, index 0 has 2
         * Fourth number is 2
         *
         * Giving us 3142.
         *
